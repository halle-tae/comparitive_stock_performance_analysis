# Comparative Stock Performance Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes stock performance using time series data and various statistical methods. The analysis is divided into multiple sections to answer specific questions or tasks related to the stock data's performance over time.

## Features

- **Data Handling with Pandas**: The notebook utilizes `pandas` for efficient data manipulation and visualization of stock prices, volume, and other key metrics.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Tools like `ccf` (cross-correlation function) are employed to explore relationships between different stock performance variables.
- **Custom Plotting**: Visualizations are generated using `matplotlib`, with specific configurations to ensure consistent sizing across plots (e.g., `figsize 15x10` for plots in sections Q1 to Q3).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing trends and insights.
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical analysis and time series tools.
